/**
 * Content Visibility Utilities
 *
 * Provides CSS `content-visibility` utilities for rendering performance
 * optimization. When a page has many MD3 components (each with custom
 * properties, state layers, elevation), rendering cost grows quickly.
 *
 * `content-visibility: auto` tells the browser to skip rendering for
 * off-screen elements, dramatically reducing initial paint time and
 * memory usage in long scrollable pages.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Always pair `content-auto` with `contain-intrinsic-size`
 * (or the longhand `contain-intrinsic-block-size`) to give the browser
 * an estimated height. Without it, off-screen elements collapse to 0px
 * and the scrollbar will jump as the user scrolls.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   <!-- Lazy-render a heavy card list section -->
 *   <section class="content-auto" style="contain-intrinsic-size: auto 500px">
 *     <!-- many MD3 cards with elevation, state layers, palette... -->
 *   </section>
 *
 *   <!-- Hide an element while preserving its rendering state (faster than display:none toggle) -->
 *   <div class="content-hidden">
 *     <!-- offscreen panel content -->
 *   </div>
 *
 * Browser support: Chrome 85+, Edge 85+, Firefox 125+, Safari 18+.
 * Falls back gracefully — unsupported browsers simply render everything
 * as normal (no visual breakage).
